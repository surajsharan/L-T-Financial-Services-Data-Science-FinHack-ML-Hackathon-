About LTFS Data Science FinHack ( ML Hackathon)
L&T Financial Services & Analytics Vidhya presents ‘DataScience FinHack’.
Amazing opportunity for all creative nerds to apply their data science & machine learning skillset to best solve a real business problem.
In this FinHack, participants were suppose to develop a model for LTFS most common but real challenge ‘Loan Default Prediction’ & also, get a feel of LTFS business!

## Problem Statement
***Vehicle Loan Default Prediction*** 
Financial institutions incur significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. This has led to the tightening up of vehicle loan underwriting and increased vehicle loan rejection rates. The need for a better credit risk scoring model is also raised by these institutions. 

This warrants a study to estimate the determinants of vehicle loan default. A financial institution has hired you to accurately predict the probability of loanee/borrower defaulting on a vehicle loan in the first EMI (Equated Monthly Instalments) on the due date. Following Information regarding the loan and loanee are provided in the datasets:

Loan Information (Demographic data like age, income, Identity proof etc.)
Loan Information (Disbursal details, amount, EMI, loan to value ratio etc.)
Bureau data & history (Bureau score, number of active accounts, the status of other loans, credit history etc.)
Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and important determinants can be identified which can be further used for minimising the default rates.


## Data Description
The dataset has the following columns :

| *Data Available*       |  *Description*                                   |
| ---------------------  | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Train**              |  Training data with details on loan 41 variables |
| **Test**               |  Test data to develop a model                    |
| **Data Dictionary**    |  Brief description on each variable provided in the Training and Test Data |  
| **Submission**         |  Submission format for the predictions on the Test data                    |


## Evaluation Metric
Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Public and Private Split
Test data is further randomly divided into Public (25%) and Private (75%) data. Your initial responses will be checked and scored on the Public data. The final rankings would be based on your private score which will be published once the competition is over.


### Leaderboard
